#  Assignment-2-task-2-of-Software-Engineering-course
This repository is created for the submission of asssignment 02 of Software Engineering course as shown below:<br>
## Task 1: Certificates
This repository includes three required certificates for:<br>
C++ Design Patterns: Structural<br>
C++ Design Patterns: Behavioral<br>
C++ Design Patterns: Creational<br>

## Task 2: Ant Farm Simulation System
This repository includes three files for implementation of Task 2:<br>
1. task2.cbp: Code::Blocks project file containing the configuration for building the project.<br>
2. main.cpp: The main source file implementing the Ant Farm Simulation System.<br>
3. task2.layout: Layout file for the project environment (specific to Code::Blocks).<br>
### Introduction
The Ant Farm Simulation System is a C++ project that models the life and activities of ants in a colony. This system demonstrates the practical application of C++ Design Patterns to create a well-structured, adaptable, and efficient simulation. The project integrates Structural, Behavioral, and Creational Design Patterns, such as Singleton, Factory, Mediator, Decorator, and more, making the code maintainable and extendable.<br>
This simulation allows users to interact with ant colonies through a command-line interface, enabling actions like resource management, battles between colonies, and tracking the lifespan of each farm. It is a practical demonstration of how design patterns solve complex problems effectively while ensuring code reusability.

### Features
1. Realistic modeling of ant colony behaviors, such as resource gathering, expanding farms, and colony defense.<br>
2. Tick-based simulation for step-by-step progression and easy event tracking.<br>
3. Command-line interface for creating and managing colonies interactively.<br>
4. Implementation of modern C++ Design Patterns for flexibility and scalability.<br>

### Design Patterns
The system is built using the following design patterns:<br>

Structural Design Patterns: Implements Decorator and Composite for organizing relationships between objects.<br>
Behavioral Design Patterns: Uses Command and Strategy patterns for controlling ant behaviors and managing user interactions.<br>
Creational Design Patterns: Includes Singleton and Factory patterns for efficient object creation and lifecycle management.<br>

### Requirements
Before running the simulation, ensure the following tools are installed:<br>
1. A C++ compiler supporting C++17 or later.<br>
2. Code::Blocks IDE (optional, if using .cbp files).<br>
3. Git for cloning the repository.<br>

### How to Run
1.Clone the repository: <br>
2. Copy code: git clone <repository_link><br>
3. Open in Code::Blocks:<br>
4. Open the task2.cbp file in Code::Blocks IDE to load the project.<br>
Build the project: Compile the project in Code::Blocks or using your preferred build method.<br>
5. Run the simulation: Execute the compiled file to start the simulation.<br>

### Usage
Once the simulation starts, you can:<br>
1. Create ant colonies with unique species and names.<br>
2. Provide resources to colonies to grow their strength.<br>
3. Simulate ticks to track colony progress over time.<br>
4.Engage in battles between colonies to test survival strategies.<br>
5. Display summaries of colony statuses, including lifespan, kills, and defeated colonies.<br>
